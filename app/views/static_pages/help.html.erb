<strong>Data We Collect From You</strong>
<p>In order to operate the Site and to provide you with information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly (without using the Site) such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) or "demographic information" (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information. Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public information", which consists of ride transaction information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the Site; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other demographic information. Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect, keep or maintain personal information from children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old. <br><br>
<strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong>
<p>We use your email address and your other personal information to help us efficiently operate the Site, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the Site (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect your relationship with the Site), to forward trip information to you from other Site users and to contact you and others to suggest potential carpool matches. These types of communications, are known as "Operational Communications." In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.
<p>To operate the Site, including processing your transactions and supporting your activities on the Site, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, and order fulfillment. We require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.
<p>By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or material by mail) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us.
<p>Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. <br><br>
<strong>How We Use Demographic Data</strong>

<p>We may review all demographic Data. We may use public information to enable other users to search your profile, to determine whether your trip details fit other user's requirements, and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the Site and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to you as a KevPool user. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular Site users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic group. <br><br>
<strong>How to Edit Your Information</strong>

There you can view, update and correct your account information. You may edit your profile at any time -- all you need is your username and password.
<p>So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 are not allowed to register as KevPool.com members, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our members' ages. Please contact us at charette@grinnell.edu to find out how to change information you cannot access through your Profile.
<p>Our databases automatically update any personal information you edit in your profile, or that you request we edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remain in our databases and become the property of KevPool.com upon submission. Keep this in mind if you decide to communicate personal information through any of these applications. <br><br>
<strong>Information Retention</strong>
<p>To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. KevPool.com understands your submissions as consent to store all your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if we so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify member information by erasing it from our database. We will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information. If you wish to make such a request, which requires that we verify your identity, or if you have any questions regarding this policy, contact KevPool.com at support@KevPool.com.
